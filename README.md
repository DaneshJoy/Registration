### Main Steps

- [x] Prepare VTK/ITK Environment
- [x] Prepare Sample Data (Source/Target  Point-Clouds)
- [x] Visualize Point-Clouds
- [x] Crop Image Points with Outer+Inner Bounding-Boxes of Tracker Points
- [ ] Collect Dummy points (Landmark + Surface)
- [ ] Random Noise + Transform on Dummy Points
- [ ] Register with Dummy points (simulation)
  - [ ] ICP
  - [ ] CPD
- [ ] Test with More Real Data
