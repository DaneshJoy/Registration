### Main Steps

- [x] ~~Prepare VTK/ITK Environment~~
- [x] ~~Prepare Sample Data (Source/Target  Point-Clouds)~~
- [ ] Visualize Point-Clouds
  - [ ] Python
  - [ ] C++
- [ ] Register Point-Clouds
  - [ ] Python
  - [ ] C++
- [ ] Test Multiple Algorithms
  - [ ] Python
  - [ ] C++
- [ ] Test the Registration Algorithms with Cropped Surface (Regarding the Landmark Positions)
- [ ] Test with More Data

### Future Plans

- [ ] ICP / NDT
  1-Get PCL Using vcpackage:
      https://pointclouds.org/
      https://pointclouds.org/downloads/#cross-platform
      https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
  2- Use this for ICP and NDT:
      https://github.com/hummat/registration
